[Sibling to Outliner for AI](https://github.com/Inventsable/Outliner), experimenting with After Effects expression injection and creating a newgen, homebrewed Create Nulls To Paths:

Works on simple shapes of any nested group depth, with exception to complex nested anchor and rotation of parent path, with highly configurable `anchors`, `sticks`, and `handles` shapes.

Would want to make this dynamic enough to handle Receiving (shown above) and Driving the path data, want to reconsider things, practice more expressions in AE, and come back to this later
